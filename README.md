ckanext-dasish
==============

This is a CKAN extension that is used in the DASISH Metadata portal: http://ckan.dasish.eu/

There are two ways to use CKAN. One way is to use it as it is without modifying the default user interface. The other way is to modify and extend it. For the DASISH Metadata catalogue, we modified CKAN for two reasons: a) to enable faceted search, and b) to enable a slideshow of the communities at the homepage.
